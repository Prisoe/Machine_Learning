# Machine_Learning
We use streamlit to create the front end of our project. it's pretty easy and simple to use
We ran our backend using Jupyter notebook where we used Linear regression mean square error to check the accuracy of our model
We used DecisionTreeRegressor as our First predictor, RandomForestRegressor as our second regressor and GridSearchCV as our final model to predict the average salaries
We then returned the value of the y-pred to the predict on our streamlit app
First ever machine model created 😁
